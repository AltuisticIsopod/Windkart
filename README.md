# Windkart E-commerce Platform

**Windkart** is a simplified e-commerce application inspired by Flipkart, developed to explore and implement **Next.js Server Actions**. This project demonstrates the integration of server-side functionalities within a modern React framework, aiming to provide a seamless shopping experience.

## Key Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays a curated list of products with detailed information.
- **Shopping Cart**: Allows users to add or remove items, with real-time updates.
- **User Authentication**: Implements secure login and registration processes.
- **Order Management**: Enables users to place orders and view order history.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Utilized for its robust server-side rendering capabilities and the introduction of Server Actions.
- **React**: Employed for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Applied for efficient and responsive styling.
- **MongoDB**: Serves as the database for storing user and product information.

## Learning Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to delve into **Next.js Server Actions**, which facilitate server-side data mutations and form handling without the need for traditional API routes. This approach enhances performance and simplifies the codebase by:

- **Reducing Client-Server Round Trips**: Server Actions allow for direct server-side data handling, minimizing the need for client-side API calls.
- **Simplifying Form Handling**: Forms can directly interact with server-side functions, streamlining data processing and validation.
- **Enhancing Security**: By handling sensitive operations on the server, the application reduces exposure to potential client-side vulnerabilities.

For more detailed information on Server Actions, refer to the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations).
